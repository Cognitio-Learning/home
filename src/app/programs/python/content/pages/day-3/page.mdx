# Day 3: Functions and Modules

## Functions in Python

- Defining and calling functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Scope of variables (local vs. global)


## Built-in Python modules

- Importing and using modules
- Overview of common built-in modules (math, random, time)


## Introduction to external libraries

- Pip and package management (basic introduction)
- Importing and using external libraries


## Hands-on project: Personal Library Organizer

Students will develop a Python script that organizes their personal library. The script will allow users to add, remove, search, list, and recommend books in their collection.
