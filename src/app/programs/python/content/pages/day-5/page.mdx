# Day 5: Building AI Projects

Congratulations on making it to the final day! Today, we will bring everything we've learned together to build real-world AI projects.

## Objectives

- Combine Python basics with AI concepts
- Build a simple Chatbot or Prediction model
- Understand the project lifecycle

## Project 1: Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

## Project 2: Text Sentiment Analyzer (Conceptual)

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning! To continue your journey:
1.  Explore libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
2.  Practice coding on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
3.  Build your own small projects to solve problems you care about.

Good luck!
