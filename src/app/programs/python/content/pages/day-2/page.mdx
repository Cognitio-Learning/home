# Day 2: Python Control Structures

## Conditional statements

- If, elif, and else statements
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)


## Loops

- For loops and their applications
- While loops and when to use them
- Loop control statements (break, continue)


## Lists and basic list operations

- Creating and accessing list elements
- List methods (append, remove, len, etc.)
- Iterating through lists


## Hands-on project: Number Guessing Game

Students will develop a simple number guessing game using conditional statements and loops. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will have to guess it.
